Although various parametric and non-parametric approaches are being proposed to\nclassify information from data, classification tree diagrams provide an\ninteractive visualization to analysts as compared to other methods.\nHealth informatics deal with the methods used to optimize the acquisition,\nstorage and retrieval of medical data, and classify information in healthcare\napplications. In this\nwork we discuss application of classification tree diagrams to classify\ninformation from medical data in healthcare applications.",
