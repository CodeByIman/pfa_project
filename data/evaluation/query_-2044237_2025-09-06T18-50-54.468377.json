In\nresponse, the need for efficient handling of biomedical big data has been\npartly met by parallel computing. However, the time demand of many\nbioinformatics programs still remains high for large-scale practical uses due\nto factors that hinder acceleration by parallelization. Recently, new\ngenerations of storage devices have emerged, such as NAND flash-based\nsolid-state drives (SSDs), and with the renewed interest in near-data\nprocessing, they are increasingly becoming acceleration methods that can\naccompany parallel processing. In certain cases, a simple drop-in replacement\nof hard disk drives (HDDs) by SSDs results in dramatic speedup. Despite the\nvarious advantages and continuous cost reduction of SSDs, there has been little\nreview of SSD-based profiling and performance exploration of important but\ntime-consuming bioinformatics programs. For an informative review, we perform\nin-depth profiling and analysis of 23 key bioinformatics programs using\nmultiple types of devices. Based on the insight we obtain from this research,\nwe further discuss issues related to design and optimize bioinformatics\nalgorithms and pipelines to fully exploit SSDs. The programs we profile cover\ntraditional and emerging areas of importance, such as alignment, assembly,\nmapping, expression analysis, variant calling, and metagenomics. We explain how\nacceleration by parallelization can be combined with SSDs for improved\nperformance and also how using SSDs can expedite important bioinformatics\npipelines, such as variant calling by the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and\ntranscriptome analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We hope that this review\ncan provide useful directions and tips to accompany future bioinformatics\nalgorithm design procedures that properly consider new generations of powerful\nstorage devices.",
