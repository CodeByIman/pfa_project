Abstract. Artificialintelligence(AI)anddeeplearningtechniqueshave
gained significant attraction in recent years, owing to their remarkable
capability of achieving high performance across a broad range of ap-
plications. However, a crucial challenge in training such models is the
acquisition of vast amounts of data, which is often limited in fields like
healthcare. In this domain, medical data is typically scattered across
various sources such as hospitals, clinics, and wearable devices. The ag-
gregated data collected from multiple sources in the healthcare domain
is sufficient for training advanced deep learning models. However, these
sources are frequently hesitant to share such data due to privacy con-
siderations. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed the in-
tegration of blockchain and federated learning to develop a system that
facilitates the secure sharing of medical records. This work provides a
succinct review of the current state of the art in the use of blockchain
and federated learning in the decentralized healthcare domain.
Keywords: federated learning, blockchain, healthcare
1 Introduction
Thegrowingcollectionofdatahasraisedseriousconcernsregardingprivacy,par-
ticularly for medical data, which can be obtained from healthcare providers and
wearable devices. Such data encompasses a wide range of information, includ-
ingtreatments,drugs,prescriptions,tests,images,andvitalsigns.Nevertheless,
medical data is often dispersed across multiple entities, and the availability of
large-scale medical datasets is limited. For instance, researchers in [1] trained a
machine learning model with only 303 records. To tackle these challenges, the
combination of Federated Learning (FL) and Blockchain (BC) technology has
beenproposedtoenabledatasharingwhilepreservingprivacy.Bymeansoffed-

to make the system decentralized, transparent, immutable, and self-controlled
by using smart contracts.
There exist reviews about using blockchain in the medical fields as given
in [4] and [5]. The usage of federated learning for healthcare is discussed in
[6]. To our knowledge, there is no review of the usage of both techniques in

or through a decentralized mechanism facilitated by a blockchain-based smart

learning has been used to train data locally instead of sharing it. Differential
privacy was applied on top of the federated learning to increase privacy pro-
tection. The role of blockchain in their framework is managing the federated
learning process in a decentralized way. Specifically, the blockchain had a role
in aggregating the global model, handling clients’ reputations and the quality
of their contributions, and storing the local and global models in Interplanetary
File System (IPFS). In addition, the blockchain in this solution allows users to
track the decision path, i.e. the used model and dataset.

Using federated learning has a problem when dealing with non-independent
identically distributed (non-IID) data. The reason is that the data are different
at each federated agent and there is a risk of training each local model using
imbalanced data. Researchers in [8] implemented a two-step solution to tackle
this problem. The first step is building a uniformly distributed subset of the
data by receiving raw data from the participants. The composed dataset is then
senttotheparticipanttoincludeintheirtrainingalongwiththeirlocaldataset.
This way, the problem of having imbalanced data is less. The blockchain here is
used to share the composed dataset. The second step is having each participant
trainingthemachinelearningmodelusingtheirownprivatedataalongwiththe
shared dataset in the first step.
In [9], a blockchain and federated learning-based platform was built to pre-
serve privacy and distribute the learning process between different clinics. The
aggregation of local models has been done by centralized nodes using Secure
Multiparty Computation (SMPC) technique. The nodes encrypt the aggregated
model to increase privacy and send the encrypted model to the leader, which is

(SDNs) if further training is needed. Simulation using a Breast Cancer Dataset
has been done to test the proposed system.
The work presented in [10] includes an approach to construct large medical
datasets from diverse data sources. Blockchain technology is leveraged to regu-
late access to off-chain nodes. Additionally, federated learning is employed with
modifications to train local models on locally stored data, thereby maintaining
privacy through decentralized training.
A blockchain and federated learning middleware that is responsible for de-
ciding whether to give an entity access to the patients’ data or not was built in

depending on the patient’s condition and the information of the entity request-
ing access to the data. The trained AI model will give three different levels of
risk:critical,serious,andstable.Accordingtothoselevels,thedecisionofgiving
access or not is taken. Blockchain was used to make the system decentralized,
i.e. replacing the centralized server for aggregating the global model. The global
and local models are stored on the blockchain as well.
3 Conclusion
Combining blockchain and federated learning has emerged as a promising so-
lution for sharing medical data while preserving privacy. The decentralized na-
ture of blockchain and the ability of federated learning to train models locally
while sharing only model parameters make this approach well-suited for health-
care. The reviewed papers used both premissionless (public) and permissioned
blockchains and aggregated local models either through a centralized server or
decentralized smart contracts. Blockchain played a crucial role in decentralizing
the system, managing privacy, and authorizing access to required data.
Remarkable results have been achieved by combining federated learning and
blockchain techniques to classify data located at different nodes. According to
[7],asuccessrateof85%inclassifyingCOVID-19caseshasbeenachievedusing
this approach. Furthermore, [8] tested their system with three different datasets
and demonstrated that sharing a small amount of raw data while conducting
federated learning can increase accuracy when dealing with non-IID data. In
another study, [9] trained a deep learning model on the Breast Cancer Wis-
consin dataset by distributing it over several nodes, achieving an f1-score of
approximately 99%. Finally, researchers in [11] compared their platform with a
centralized approach and demonstrated that training a model on small datasets
dispersedthroughdifferentnodescanachieveresultsthataresimilartothoseof
a centralized solution with a large dataset.
