accuracy, reliability, and the production capability of electronic devices
by playing a very important part in the industry of healthcare. The avail-
able medical resources and services related to healthcare are working to
get an interconnection with each other by the digital healthcare system
by the contribution of the researchers. Sensors, wearable devices, medical
devices, and clinical devices are all connected to form an ecosystem of
the Internet of Medical Things. The different applications of healthcare
are enabled by the Internet of Medical Things to reduce the healthcare
costs, to attend the medical responses on time and it also helps in in-
creasing the quality of the medical treatment. The healthcare industry
is transformed by the Internet of Medical Things as it delivers targeted
and personalized medical care and it also seamlessly enables the
communication of medical data. Devices used in the medical field and

1 Introduction
A network of medical devices and people are envisioned by the Internet of Medical
Devices (IoMT) by which the data of healthcare are exchanged with the help of
wireless communication [61]. Since the advanced technology and the population are
increasing and growing all over the globe day by day the services of the healthcare
sector and the cost of healthcare are also increasing every day[7]. In the coming
days, if the healthcare sector and the internet of medical things
*

work together then the quality of life can be improved, much better care services
will be offered to the population and more systems can be created that will be cost-
effective too[58].
The lives are changing in such a way that was never imagined by anyone in the
past with the help of IoT and IoMT[14]. Not like the regular paradigm, each object
is connected in the world of the Internet of Things and every object is considered
as the smart object. “Internet of Things” is a network of things that are physical
and virtual, and which is dynamic and self-configuring as well. Communication
protocols that are inter-operable, media, and standards are the power backups
of the Internet of Things. “Internet of things” is said to be the latest version of
technologies such as information and communication[8]. The Internet of Things are
having the identities and attributes that can connect the network of information
like the internet, and able to work as sensors, data processors, networking, and
communication tools. New challenges are opened in the domain of the healthcare
sector by the Internet of Things (IoT), in terms of appliances that are smart,
which is known as the Internet of Medical Things. Significant advantages are
offered by the Internet of Medical Things for the people’s well-being by improving
the quality of their life and dropping down their medical expenses.
Since the number of patients are increasing every day, the regular and traditional
systems of the healthcare sector are suffering so many challenges. The Internet of
medical things are introduced so that the issue and challenges can be addressed,
and the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency can be increased by equivalent time, the
effectiveness of the domain of the health care sector can also be increased. To give a
much more effective and efficient response to the needs of the patient’s Internet of
medical things are considered as the process of enhancement and investment as
well[59]. There are various issues and the challenges that are faced by IoMT like
no proper security system, problems in privacy measures, no proper training, and
awareness regarding IoMT. Several applications of the Internet of Medical Things
that are very closely associated with the sensitive ser- vices which are related to the
healthcare sector are handling the information of the patients which are very
private and sensitive such as the name of the patient, their address, and their
conditions related to health[60]. To preserve the privacy of the patient without
going down the level of security is the most challenging part of the domain of
IoMT. It is very important to have a solution for security and privacy in IoMT
which includes very little computation involvement, and which requires very few
resources[58].
In the smart ecosystem of healthcare, the major step is the utilization of the
potential of the technologies that already exist, to deliver the services that are
best for the users and improve their life in a much better way. Wireless sensors
are very critical elements. They are used to monitor the health status of the
patients remotely and then communicate the information to the caregivers by
the help of information and communication technologies[3]. The Internet of
medical things acquires significant help from an empowering technology like
artificial intelligence which is assisting the experts of the medical field in their
proficiency areas like their clinical decisions[52][15]. By the use of the data
which is generated by
Security and Privacy of Internet of Medical Things 3
the professionals of the healthcare feedback the feed backs of the patients, the
computers are learning the normal and abnormal decisions with the help of
techniques such as machine learning and deep learning.
There is so much use of sensors of Body sensors in the Medical field to get
the data of the patient easily from distant places instead of connecting with
several biosensors and utilizing lots of money. Due to the issues of hacking,
there is a threat of security while accessing the body sensor network, therefore,
the sensitive details of the patients are secured by developing a secured fuzzy
extractor and combining it with a fuzzy vault to provide more security by the
use of bio metric key authentication system[26].
Since there is a huge development in the communication system in recent
years, there is wide use of the internet of medical things in the healthcare sector.
With the help of IoMT, the health data of the patient can be continuously
monitored without the involvement of the laboratories by the use of wireless
healthcare techniques and it will also improve the quality of life all over the
world[52]. Body sensor network helps to monitor the health data of the elderly
people and the children as well by their well-wishers in a much effective manner
since they are considered as the major population of the globe and are the main
concern by their well-wishers in terms of their health issues. IoMT is dependent
on the healthcare systems that are using physical information like body
temperature, skin resistance, signals of ECG, and EEG which is taken as the inputs
by the sensor network known as Body Sensor Network or BSN[41].
2 RISKS OF INTERNET OF MEDICAL THINGS
There are so many risks that are associated with the deploy- meant of IoT of
medical in the domain of healthcare. Some of them are:
1) The medical condition of the patient and the reputation of the hospital
can be seriously affected if the personal information of the patient is disclosed.
2) The medical complication will be generated if the transmitted data is
altered and modified by any medical device due to the falsification of data which
will lead to the incorrect medical description and high drug dose[53].
3) Sometimes the employees that are unsatisfied with their job or when they
are associated with some organized crime activity or being bribed leaks the
medical details and the crucial information of the patients which leads to the
risk of privacy and life of the patient.
4) Due to lack of training the nurses and doctors can bring in permanent
disabilities or even sometimes losing the life of the patient.
5) The life of the patient can be seriously affected and sometimes they are
led to disabilities and fatalities due to the inaccurate medical operations done
by some specialized robots[12].
Despite all these challenges and risks, it is seen that the Internet of Medical
Things is the combination of reliability and safety of the devices that are used
in the medical field that are traditionally used and the dynamic, scalable and
generous capability of traditional IoT. A combination of “Internet of medical
4 Security and Privacy of Internet of Medical Things
things” and “Internet of Things” are solving issues of the elderly and the dis-
eases that are chronic by managing so many devices that are deployed for many
patients, and at the same time, they are enough generic to look after so many
diseases which require hydrogenous monitoring and actuation. Standardization
is the major challenge that is faced by the Internet of Medical Things. It is
very important to have the standardization of all the medical devices that are
working together, and the vendors need to go for the correct security measures
to have the protection of getting hacked[20]. The Internet of medical things are
also providing the solutions to the challenges like the mobility of the patient
which means that if the patient is unable to move, even then he can be
monitored, and medical facilities can be provided at their comfort zone by the
use of IoMT. Instead of having so many issues, risks and challenges, there is a
demand for the latest technological issues for the systems of healthcare,
developing are trying to give the solutions to these visitors to change the way of
delivering better healthcare to the world.
Since the use and development of medical devices that are connected and
distributed, the advent of IoT of medical is caused and this also brings in the
applications that are promising and potential but are challenging at the same
time[11]. There is so much use of a network of Body sensors on the Internet of
Medical Things to get the data of the patient easily from distant places instead of
connecting with several biosensors and utilizing lots of money. The integration
of devices that are wearable to the IoMT is more focused instead of medical de-
vices that are personal since they are often coming as wearable devices. Sensors,
wearable devices, medical devices, and clinical devices are all connected to form
an ecosystem of the Internet of Medical Things. There are some concerns which
need to address by the biomedical devices because of the strict ethical standards
of the medical community. These concerns are
1) Reliability: Each time the functional goals need to achieve by a reliable
system, which means that in normal operating circumstances unexpected failure
should not accrue. It is mandatory to be reliable for the potential diagnostic
nature of systems of IoT of medical so that it can give guaranteed information
that is collected.
2) Safety: The operating system should not be harmed in any way by a safe
system. In terms of the Internet of medical things, particularly for the medical
actuators, it should have the proven facts that the users will not be harmed by
the system in any case.
3) Security: The system related to the medical field should all must have
protection from the threats and attacks from the external devices since they are
collecting very sensitive and personal information of the users[57].
3 LITERATURE REVIEW
Al-Turjman, Nawaz, and Ulusar (2019) studied the status of the internet of
medical things for the industry of healthcare; they had also studied the research
and plans of development and their applications[2]. Instead of having so many
Security and Privacy of Internet of Medical Things 5
technical and design issues and challenges, there is an exponential increase in
the implementation of the Internet of medical things in the healthcare sector.
Challenges are depicted and the generic framework of the “Internet of medical
things” are shown which is composed of three major components to demonstrate
the major challenges like the acquisition of data, gateways for communication,
and the servers or the cloud[56]. Sensory technologies, wearable and non-wearable
sensors are used to collect the data. To monitor a patient, it is good to use
the wearable sensors since it will not interrupt the day to day activities of the
patients. It is found that these technologies are helping caregivers and also drop-
ping the cost of healthcare. A long and short-range of a communication network
for the Internet of Medical Things in different cases is surveyed. It is found that
WANs are the very reliable, trustworthy, and robust infrastructure of networks
in the industry of healthcare when it comes to the accuracy of the data, mobility,
and the safety of the patients but it is seen that they are consuming so much
of power[42]. It is also found that the Decision Tools are a very good tool to make
clinical decisions and enhance the services related to healthcare as it is effective
in terms of cost and efficiency as well. Since there is no whole sole model of DM
which can perform consistently for all the sets of data and therefore it is advised
to the hybrids and combination of various tools that can support all the systems.
Joyia et al. (2017) found that there are so many people who had contributed
to the Internet of medical things in the domain of healthcare and there are
so many applications and challenges of IoMT as well when it comes to the
services related to the medical and healthcare sector[33]. It is seen that the
Internet of medical things has so much potential in the medical domain and the
work will help the researchers the ones who are working in this field to identify
the challenges on the Internet of Medical Things. The researchers will get to
know about the applications of IoMT and its use in the healthcare sector.
Kumar and Parthasarathy (2020) studied the Body sensor network which
has the scheme of secure authentication and effective as well [36]. The algorithm
which is proposed by the researchers can solve the problems of damage of data,
consumption of more energy, and the delay in the network in a much effective
manner[24]. Discrete wavelet transforms are used to extract the features in the
signals[16]. Users can decide the level the filters in the algorithm and the features
extraction accuracy is increased when the level of filters is increased. The noise
ratio of the signal is responsible for the efficiency of feature classification which
can be removed by using the technique of effective adaptive filtering[22]. It is found
that the noise is reduced to up to four percent by this filter in comparison to other
techniques that are used previously that is why it is used to lower down the noise
in input signals which are complex as a much effective tool. The techniques which
are proposed in the study show true positive with an average of forty percent
and a false positive rate which is also reduced in comparison to the Bayesian
network which was already in use. The total energy consumption is also reduced
by up to twenty percent[62][17]. The authentication phase and the key
generation of the system are aimed at this method. A physical layer needs to be
developed in the time ahead and aa more effective communication protocol
will be required
6 Security and Privacy of Internet of Medical Things
for the improvement of security in MAC and besides, to achieve the enhanced
overhead efficiency and effective routing protocol will be required to be designed
in the time ahead.
Yaacoub et al. (2019) concluded that there is a requirement of the design of
intrusion detection or a prevention system which is more efficient, and which can
cooperate with the honey spots having a dynamic shadow [40]. A security
solution is proposed which has five layers for the detection and from the
prevention of attacks and it should have the ability to reduce and correct the
damage which is the result of these attacks and preserve the privacy of the
patients at the same time[25]. But it is said that the major challenges which are
still surrounding the Internet of Medical Things are zero-day attacks and
exploits.
Alsubaei et al. (2019) found an Internet of Medical Things Security
Assessment Framework which a web-based application and is dependent on the
novel ontological environment and it ensures the security of the solutions on the
Internet of Medical Things [1]. In detail, a list of attributes of assessment is
recommended by the Internet of Medical Things security assessment framework
in which all the essential security measures are covered. This allows the adopters
of the Internet of Medical things to select and forces the security in solutions of
the Internet of Medical Things which is based on their security aims and which
is can be altered in a different scenario. The novelty of the Internet of Medical
Things Security Assessment Framework is in their ability to adopt the latest
technologies that are emerging and the new stakeholders, granularity, and
standard compliance[44]. There are cases where the administrators of the system
are the all alone responsible for the making the decisions that are related to the
security, but an excellent opportunity id provided to the stakeholders by this
work to had personal experience in the cut-throat sector of security on the
Internet of Medical Things. Stakeholders are allowed to get to know about the
associated risks which are there with the medical devices and they can follow best
practices to overcome the risks and go for better decisions.
Cecil et al. (2018) studied that in the framework of cyber training there is
a very limited scope of surgery training [5]. The professional is trained to do the
surgical process in orthopedics only for plastic surgery which is majorly done
for the fracture of the femur bone. GENI dependent networking technologies
are playing a great role and support the activities of cyber training[9]. The design
of the simulation environment is discussed in detail[23]. In a medical
university, the residents of the orthopedic field are using the framework which is
based on internet of medical things for their training activities; in their
assessment part of studies, they are adopting the frameworks which are based on
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in their surgical training and education.
Elhoseny et al. (2019) studied a group of experimentation which is done by
the use of data which is collected from the women who are having a high risk of
ovarian cancer due to the family history or history of cancer for an individual [27]
[28]. While comparing the data with the recurrent neural networks which are also
known as RSS with the feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and with some
others, it is seen that the method which is proposed is attaining Amax accuracy
Security and Privacy of Internet of Medical Things 7
of the sensitivity of 96.27 and 85.2 of the rates of specificity[62]. The results of the
experiments show that the model which is proposed is very useful in detecting
cancer at their initial stages. The model can detect the er with high accuracy,
root means square with low error, sensitivity, and specificity as well.
Farahat et al. (2018) studied a model that has real-time security and it also
has an encryption method which is encoded with the authentication [28]. This
model can solve the security problems of Internet of Medical Smart Things
(IoMST). Internet of Medical Smart Things is facing a very big issue of real-time
security and privacy as well[50]. A technique of run-length encoding is presented
in the study which is followed by the encryption that has a key that is rotating in
the system of the patient and the data is decrepitude which has a rotated key and
it is decoded with the decoding run-length technique in the system of the
physician. The integrity of the record is ensured by the digital signature of the
patient. Further, the study can be done by focusing on developing a shield of E-
health which will collect all the data from the sensors of the Internet of Medical
Smart Things and a system is developed by them who can do the encryption by
using the asynchronous method. If the number of sensors is increased in our
system, it can be implemented for solving the problems of big data. Then it is
possible to implement a personal blockchain of the health record of the
patient[21].
Gatouillat et al. (2018) revealed that the validation and verification of the
system can also be done along with the robustness, security, and reliability of
the system by an approach of cyber-physical systems CPS) [29]. While designing a
biomedical system these are the crucial questions, cyber-physical systems are
the much better process of designing for implementing, designing, and deploying
such kind of systems in the biomedical field.
Guan et al. (2019) found that the technique of machine learning can be
used for data processing which is involved in the Internet of Medical Things for
the analysis of the medical data and diagnosis of the diseases [30]. At the same
time, it is very important to pay great attention to the personal privacy information
disclosure so that the personal and sensitive medical data of the patient and the
hospital is not leaked out. The technique of cluster analysis plays an important
role in e diagnosis of diseases and medical analysis. Efficient Def- eventually
Private Data Clustering scheme (EDPDCS) which is based on the Map-Reduce
framework is proposed in this study to allow the Privacy-preserving cluster analysis
on the Internet of Medical Things. It is found that when the data sets of the
algorithm of normalized Intra-cluster variance is compared with other data set of
the algorithms it is seen that the accuracy of the deferentially private k- means is
improved by Efficient Deferentially Private Data Clustering scheme (EDPDCS).
Dimitrov (2016) found that the new category of advisors of digital health
will emerge in the future. This category of advisors of digital health care is skilled
and they had they are capable of interpreting the data of the health and well-
being of the patient [41]. They are helping their clients to avoid their illness
which is chronic in nature chronic and their diet-related problems, cognitive
function are improved, in achieving mental health, which is improved, and
they are also

helping their clients in achieving an overall improved lifestyle. Such roles of the
Internet of Medical Things are becoming very important due to the elderly of
the world population.
Jin et al. (2019) found that the prediction of the quantity of the patients
from the outside is not a problem of simple time series and there are so many
factors of different variety which are nonlinear, and they are influencing this
problem[32]. At the same time in some other experiments, a prediction model was
proposed which is multi-dimensional it has a feature of air quality which is much
better than other models. Through the analysis of the data of the experiments, it
is found that a very important and significant role is played by the indicators of
air quality in the prediction of the respiratory clinic of the patients from outside
and their visit to the clinic. The prediction of respiratory consultations and its
significant lag effect and a lag prediction of four days which has a better effect
are discussed in the paper. On the analysis of the results, it is seen that there is
a lagging effect of air in respiratory diseases.
Liu et al. (2019) studied the involvement of Medical IoT of medical in the
lung cancer treatment and the potential application of models of deep reinforcement
learning in the diagnosis which involves the computers[34]. Models of deep
reinforcement learning are presented in particular which had promised to be
used in the localization and treatment of lung cancer. If the tumor of the lung
is detected and diagnosed at their initial stages, then the effect of the treatment
is improved and there is a chance of prolonging survival in much significant
manner. The open challenging matters and applications of the model of deep
reinforcement learning for the diagnosing and treating of lung cancer are dis-
cussed further in this study. It is seen that there are two major research directs
thatch can be possibly proposed in the future which involves the localization of
the tumors and the making the plan of treating it.
Wang et al. (2020) studied and designed an eencoderdecoder structure that
is densely connected This structure shares the codes and at the same time integrates
the decoders the depths which are different from each other[38]. The structure
which is densely connected is correlated by the output of the multiple decoders [51].
An adaptive segmentation algorithm was proposed by the use of this structure for
shallow and deep features. The advantages and benefits of the model which is
proposed for the complex boundary segmentation were verified when the two sets
of data were compared in the horizontal and vertical manner. The analysis of the
experiments demonstrates that the algorithm of the depth feature of adaptive
segmentation uses the information of different depths and the results of the
segmentation which were generated by the decoders of different depth in an
effective manner and the final results can be analyzed and by this the accuracy of
image segmentation is also improved.
Wasankar, Gulhane, and Gautam (2017) studied the system which is
known as K-Healthcare which uses four layers to work more closely and because
of which the storing and processing is done much efficiently and along with that
the valuable data is retrieved[39]. So many services are provided by this remotely
like to prevent and diagnose the disease, assessment of risk, patient health can
